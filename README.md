# Holberton School - Honey Pot Project
This repo is for a honeypot project, created with the aim of writing a white paper focusing on unsolicited internet traffic.
This project is a joint effort between [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com/) staff, students, and mentors.

## To Do
1. Install tshark: `sudo apt-get install tshark`
2. Setup filtering.
3. Setup another server to ssh tunnel through, so we don't have to create an expanding list of ip-address to exclude from the packet-captures
